      <p class="description">
        The silent source of various memes, this game is based in China and my one of aunties think my social security card has been compromised and currently in the game. After all, America is the mother of conspiracy theories. Could it actually be? Not likely but let’s see what these men would do with such special information. 
      </p>

      <h2 class="title">1. Xavier</h2>
      <img src="img/1.webp" alt="cringeotome" class="image" />
      <p class="description">
        Xavier is totally selling it for instant noodles, hotpot vouchers and activities to keep you inside which may or may not include condoms.
      </p>

      <h2 class="title">2. Zayne</h2>
      <img src="img/2.webp" alt="cringeotome" class="image" />
      <p class="description">
        Doctor Zayne would keep that filed away for safety purposes before stealing all of your macarons.
      </p>

      <h2 class="title">3. Rafayel</h2>
      <img src="img/3.webp" alt="cringeotome" class="image" />
      <p class="description">
        What would Rafayel do with such important information besides make a drawing using only your social security number to make your cute little face?
      </p>

      <h2 class="title">4. Sylus</h2>
      <img src="img/4.webp" alt="cringeotome" class="image" />
      <p class="description">
        Sylus would pay top dollar to make sure it never ended up on the black market and then go home to show you his new treasures and rail you on the couch.
      </p>

      <h2 class="title">5. Caleb</h2>
      <img src="img/5.webp" alt="cringeotome" class="image" />
      <p class="description">
        Caleb would totally throw it in a box of trinkets gathered from childhood as the only value it has to him is your name and any other information to keep you close.

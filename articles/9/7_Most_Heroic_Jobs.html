      <p class="description">
        What can we say say? During these unprecedented times, nurses are more essential than ever. Despite being overworked and underpaid, these heroes deserve much more praise for saving millions a day.

      <img src="img/1.webp" alt="sammysins" class="image" />
      <p class="description">
        With the rise of cities, these ever-vigilant heroes always need to be on the watch to ensure fire never gets out of hand. Combine that with the recent forest fires, and we get true selfless heroes.

      <h2 class="title">5. Cop</h2>

      <p class="description">
        While many police officers may be pigs, the ones that do their job properly are true heroes. Not only do they risk their lives every day, but they seldom get recognition due to the stigma surrounding police. If you know a police officer who does their job properly, please salute them.

      <h2 class="title">4. Teacher</h2>

      <p class="description">
        Teachers, despite being the backbone of society, never get any proper recognition. These heroes deserve more pay, and a hell of a lot less bullshit.
      </p>

      <h2 class="title">3. Soldier</h2>
      <img src="img/4.webp" alt="sammysins" class="image" />
      <p class="description">
        These brave citizens fought everywhere from Korea to 'Nam. Salute them when next you see one.
      </p>

      <h2 class="title">2. Priest</h2>
      <img src="img/5.webp" alt="sammysins" class="image" />
      <p class="description">
        These children of God sacrifice much of their lives in order tohelp those around them in the name of God. Though some may not be as devoted as others, the ones that truly follow the gospel, and devote their lives to charity, are true heroes.
      </p>

      <h2 class="title">1. Pornstar</h2>
      <img src="img/6.webp" alt="sammysins" class="image" />
      <p class="description">
        Some wise-ass once said: every worthy battle needs a formidable opponent. Well, on-screen fucking isn’t exactly a battle, but there is definitely a lot of hardcore back and forth power involved. This is why for every amazing female porn star out there they need a big, strong, energetic guy who really knows how to give it like he’s leading the charge of the light brigade. There is nothing that Johnny Sins can’t handle. If you want to see a little teen get lifted up and held upside down for some standing 69, you need Johnny Sins. If you want to see a thick set busty MILF get lifted off her back and get fucked so hard her flesh ripples, you need Johnny Sins. This guy is all muscle, power, and massive dick, and he’s got the stamina to take on multiple cunts and asses for your wanking pleasure. Johnny pounds that puss like a running back riding a steed through battle. He’s made more eyeliner run than every sad movie watched on Valentine’s Day by single horny girls. He’s left more girls limping than cheerleader practice on tequila. He’s six feet tall of muscle and fuck power and has got just as much length stretching out horizontally. When this guy isn’t fucking, he’s known to hit the gym or just kick back and play video games. So it’s easy to imagine Johnny is just one of the boys, except he’s your pal who gets the most poon.

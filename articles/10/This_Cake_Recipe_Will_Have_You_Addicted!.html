      <h2 class="title">Let's get started with the ingredients, you'll need:</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>1¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>2 cups sugar</li>

        <li>¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>

        <li>1½ tsp baking powder</li>

        <li>1½ tsp baking soda</li>

        <li>1 tsp salt</li>

        <li>1 tsp espresso powder (optional, but highly recommended for “kick”)</li>

        <li>2 spoonfuls of crack cocaine</li>

        <li>1 cup milk</li>

        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>

        <li>2 eggs</li>

        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="title">Directions</h2>

      <p class="description">
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C), or hotter if your dealer really really needs you to pay up quickly. Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans, or just use your grandma’s casserole dish. She won’t notice.</li>

        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and espresso powder. Stir as best you can with the withdrawal shakes.</li>

        <li>Add, oil, eggs, vanilla, and a generous hit of crack. Mix until smooth, preferably with a hand mixer but a heated spoon should do jut fine.</li>

        <li>Stir in milk — the batter will be thin, like your patience on day 4 of withdrawal.</li>

        <li>Pour batter evenly into pans. Lick the bowl. You need to lick the bowl. Lick the bowl. LICK IT NOW!</li>

        <li>Bake for 30–35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out mostly clean (some residue is fine; it’s probably just the crack).</li>

        <li>Cool in pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely — or just eat it warm with a scoop of mint ice cream in the bathtub while contemplating your life choices.</li>
      </ol>

        I hope you enjoyed this recipe! And remember, it is illegal, immoral, and might get you 25 to life. But in a pinch, it will impress Karen at the bake sale.

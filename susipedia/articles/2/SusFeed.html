  <h2 id="history">History</h2>
  <p>SusFeed reportedly began as a joke project as a collaboration between Cameron Impostor and popular archival site PBGMidi. Starting in February of 2022 with the first susarticle, "Top 10 Farts", SusFeed was an immediate hit among the wider internet, spawning the creation of the video division. SusFeed quickly grew into a widely-used and trusted news source with the addition of several new employees from a wide variety of backgrounds, such as Yugoslavian dictator Neil Divins, leading to the formal incorporation of SusFeed inc. Following a substantial uptick in traffic in 2025, SusFeed recieved a full rebranding and the addition of quizzes to the site. SusFeed has since expanded into a multimedia empire SusFeed Video, SusFeed Games, and <a href="../1/SusiPedia.html">SusiPedia</a>. Famous musician and cereal mascot Ringo Starr purchased SusFeed stock in 2025, leading to him being the "de-facto mascot" of the company.</p>

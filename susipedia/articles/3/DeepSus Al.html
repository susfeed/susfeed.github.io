  <p><b>DeepSus Al</b> (sometimes referred to as <i>DeepSus AI</i> by AI bros who can't spell) is a conversational artificial intelligence feature integrated into the news website SusFeed. The feature was created to bait and switch users in fake interactive text conversations, as users come expecting a real LLM chatbot and are instead given a glorified magic 8 ball.</p>

  <h2 id="development">Development</h2>
  <p>DeepSus Al was introduced as part of SusFeed’s attempt to modernize its user experience and compete with other web-based interactive platforms. Although an AI chatbot on the outside, DeepSus Al actually just pulls from a random list of answers within a JSON regardless of what it is prompted with. SusFeed refuses to use AI because of their long-standing issues with the ethical implications of LLMs.</p>

  <h2 id="name">Name</h2>
  <p>DeepSus Al is named after the deep- prefix given to AI tools, and the Sus branding of SusFeed. The <i>Al</i> portion comes from a SusFeed employee who wanted to dunk on AI bros.</p>

  <h2 id="features">Features</h2>
  <p>The core features of DeepSus Al include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Conversational chat:</b> Users can ask questions and receive very sussy answers in real time.</li>
    <li><b>Children's mode:</b> A mode available on SusFeed Kids that gives kid-safe answers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
  <p>Once on SusFeed Al, users will find a little gif of Howard the Alien, which will bring up a chatbox upon being clicked. Once launched, the bot engages users in a free-form text conversation. The Al does not require an account or subscription, because it isn't a real AI.</p>

  <h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
  <p>Reactions to SusFeed Al are glowing: fans of SusFeed’s news content appreciated the comentary, while AI bros were pissed off at being made fun of, which is also a win. SusFeed estimates they save an estimated 1 billion tonnes of carbon from being emitted a year by drawing people to DeepSus Al, drawing commendation from environmental groups.</p>

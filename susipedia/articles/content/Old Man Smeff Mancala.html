  <h3 id="early-life">Early life</h3>
  <p>John Smeff was born to lower-class parents in Mesopotamia in the early 6th millenium BCE. While ittle of his childhood is known, he had an interest in beads from childhood stemming from his parents' work in the mines. Smeff recieved no formal education for much of his life, gaining most of his knowledge from his many travels. His middle and last names, Smeff Mancala, was told to his parents by God, with God himself coming up with the name Smeff. The name mancala came from his divine destiny to create the game.</p>

  <h3 id="invention">Invention of mancala</h3>
  <p>John Smeff invented the game of mancala sometime in his early 20s, initially making the board out of sand pits and using spare glass beads from his parents' shop. The first game of mancala was played shortly thereafter, leading to the most eventful game of mancala in human history. This game led to Old Man Smeff's catchphrase: "you know, 6,000 years ago, during the first game of mancala".</p>

  <h3 id="middle">Unknown era</h3>
  <p>Little is known of Smeff's life following the first few games of mancala. What is known is that he was alive and active during all of history following his birth, leading to several conspiracy theories on what he was doing. The prevailing theory, hintend at by Smeff himself, is that he just kinda hung out for that time.</p>

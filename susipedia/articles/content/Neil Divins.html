  <h2 id="life">Life</h2>
  <h3 id="early">Early life</h3>
  <p>Neil was born in 2000, being too young to remember 9/11. As such, he was unable to stop the formation of My Chemical Romance, a band he thinks is just okay. The rage from not being able to prevent this made him a very angry child. It is unknown what Gerard Way did to deserve Neil's rage, but whatever it was must have been pretty serious.</p>
  <p>Neil was interested in science from a young age, leading him to develop various weapons he would later use in Yugoslavia. He picked up an interest in Kirby during this time, becomming known as the "Kirby guy", as he had beat every game 100%. Despite these interests, he went to culinary school.</p>

  <h3 id="culinary">Culinary school</h3>
  <p>Neil later went to culinary school and met the stupidest man alive. He though that 3/2 was equal to two, did not understand basic cooking temperatures, and shot at birds from a slingshot for fun. This man made Neil so angry that all of his rage was used up for the rest of his life, making him unable to feel anger.</p>

  <h2 id="education">Education</h2>
  <p>Neil started studyign chemistry at Elizabethtown College in 2021, meeting local deity God during orientation. Together, they formed the initial group that led to The Boys, and later The Boys itself. During this time, Neil became one of the initial writers for SusFeed. Neil graduated with honors in chemistry, like a nerd, despite his heavy time invested into leading Yugoslavia.</p>

  <h2 id="leader">Leadership of Yugoslavia</h2>
  <p>In 2021, Neil secretly invaded Yugoslavia, reforming the country as a brutal dictatorship. He has ruled with an iron-fist ever since, despite having a mysterious 100% approval rating. Neil currently controls the majority of Yugoslavia, though much of Croatia is controlled by Cameron Impostor as a buffer-state to the EU.</p>

  <h3 id="positions">Political positions</h3>
  <p>Neil is a left-wing authoritarian dictator, dedicating much of his politcal endeavors to promoting equality under his brutal regime. Neil heavily supports LGBT and women's rights, has enforced universal suffrage (technically, nobody being able to vote is universal), and promotes full racial equality. He was one of the signatories on the UN General Assembly's call to legalize gay marriage worldwide.</p>
  <p>Neil does not, however, support children's rights. Neil's regime has recieved widespread criticism for its use of child labor, something Neil himself refuses to end. Neil's regime is also, you know, a dictatorship, so other basic human rights like freedom of speech are completely ignored.</p>

  <h2 id="controversies">Controversies</h2>
  <h3 id="crimes">War crimes</h3>
  <p>Neil has committed thousands of war crimes. He has been denounced by all UN members states except the United States, with the chair of the United Nations calling him "literally objectively factually the worst tyrant to ever live".</p>

  <h3 id="smeff">Attempts to steal Smeff</h3>
  <p>Neil has attempted to steal the Smeff joke from Cameron Impostor over the past several years. Literally nobody believes him, because there were multiple witnesses to Cameron making the joke. The international community generally recognizes Cameron as the rightful owner, except for the United States.</p>

  <h3 id="cuck">Cuck accusations</h3>
  <p>Neil is literally literally literally not a cuck.</p>

  <p><b>Nazism</b>, formally named <b>National Socialism</b>, is the far-right totalitarian ideology associated with Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in Germany. During Hitler's rise to power, it was frequently called Hitlerism. The term "neo-Nazism" is applied to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)">groups formed after World War II with a similar ideology.</a></p>
  <p>Nazism is a form of fascism, with <a href="https://time.com/7343696/trump-floats-cancelling-2026-elections/">disdain for liberal democracy</a> and the <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/08/congress/trump-war-powers-republicans-election-00716332">parliamentary system</a>. Its beliefs include <a href="https://www.ms.now/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-militarized-cities-lot-people-are-saying-maybe-d-dictator-rcna227039">support for dictatorship</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-says-jewish-voters-will-bear-lot-blame-loses-fighting-antisemiti-rcna171938">fervent antisemitism</a>, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/11/anti-communism-week-2025/">anti-communism</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9814k2jlxko">anti-Slavism</a>, anti-Romani sentiment, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trumps-racist-rants-against-immigrants-hide-under-the-language-of-eugenics/">scientific racism</a>, <a href="https://stopaapihate.org/2025/02/20/new-data-surge-in-hate-in-response-to-donald-trumps-presidential-victory/">anti-Chinese sentiment</a>, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/trump-dines-with-white-supremacist-renewing-questions-about-gops-leadership-and-values">white supremacy</a>, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trump-wants-nordic-immigrants-norwegian-mans-reply-viral-11280506">Nordicism</a>, <a href="https://abc7.com/post/donald-trump-tariffs-news-weak-will-fail-president-says-amid-us-stock-market-crash/16130644/">social Darwinism</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/03/republicans-same-sex-marriage">homophobia</a>, <a href="https://www.ms.now/opinion/trump-slur-tim-walz-rhetoric">ableism</a>, and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-white-house-holds-news-briefing-as-biden-marks-anniversary-of-oct-7-attacks">eugenics</a>. The Nazis' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpism">ultranationalism</a> originated in pan-Germanism and the ethno-nationalist Völkisch movement, which had been prominent within German ultranationalism since the late 19th century. Nazism was influenced by the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/53498434">Freikorps paramilitary groups</a> that emerged after <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-54788636">Germany's defeat in World War I</a>, from which the party's <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/January-6-U-S-Capitol-attack">"cult of violence"</a> came. It subscribed to pseudo-scientific theories of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/02/trump-somali-immigrants-minnesota">racial hierarchy</a>, identifying ethnic Germans as part of what the Nazis regarded as a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/meeting/house/116973/documents/HHRG-118-ED00-20240417-SD006.pdf">Nordic Aryan master race</a>. Nazism sought to overcome social divisions and create a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/17/us/politics/trump-fox-interview-migrants.html">homogeneous German society based on racial purity</a>. The Nazis aimed to unite all Germans living in historically German territory, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/09/greenland-labor-union-chair-trump-annexation">gain lands for expansion</a> under the doctrine of Lebensraum, and exclude those deemed either <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/31/six-racist-bigoted-comments-trump-madison-square-garden">Community Aliens or "inferior" races</a> (Untermenschen).</p>

  <h2 id="american">Use of the American racist model</h2>
  <p>Hitler and Nazi legal theorists were inspired by America's <a href="https://www.aclu.org/trump-on-dei-and-anti-discrimination-law">institutional racism</a> and saw it as the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/thanks-donald-trump-i-know-what-it-feels-be-eyed-ncna830951">model</a> to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/05/us/politics/justice-department-disparate-impact.html">follow</a>. They saw it as a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/09/27/495611105/in-post-debate-interview-trump-again-criticizes-pageant-winners-weight">model</a> for the <a href="https://time.com/7282450/trump-annex-canada-economy-recession-upholding-the-constitution/">expansion of territory</a> and <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-trump-administration-is-erasing-american-history-told-by-public-lands-and-waters/">elimination of indigenous inhabitants</a> therefrom, for laws <a href="https://www.aila.org/library/president-trump-signs-executive-order-protecting-the-meaning-and-value-of-american-citizenship">denying full citizenship for African Americans</a>, which they wanted to implement against <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/trump-criticized-using-antisemitic-shylock-describe-bankers-2025-07-04/">Jews</a>, and for <a href="https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/president-trump-expands-his-travel-ban-what-you-need-to-know/">racist immigration laws banning "inferior" races</a>. In Mein Kampf, Hitler extolled America as the only example of a country with racist ("völkisch") citizenship statutes in the 1920s, and Nazi lawyers made use of American <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/trump-ivanka-piece-of-ass-howard-stern-229376%20">models</a> in crafting laws for Nazi Germany. US citizenship laws and anti-miscegenation laws directly inspired the two principal Nuremberg Laws—the Citizenship Law and the Blood Law (I don't even need a news article for these last two sentences, it's too on the nose).</p>

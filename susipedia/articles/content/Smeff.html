  <p><b>Smeff</b> is a joke created in 2021 by comedic genius Cameron Impostor. The joke as evolved over time, going from a simple nonsense word to a multi-layered bit upheld by many people. Though Cameron holds ample evidence of his hand in Smeff's creation, several despotic dictators have claimed Smeff as their own in a bid to seem funnier.</p>

  <h2 id="history">History</h2>

  <h3 id="invention">Invention</h3>
  <p>Smeff is one of the oldest jokes ever made by The Boys. Its creation is traced back to a match of Super Smash Bros Brawl in the Schlobby during late 2021, where Cameron typed the name as a nickname within the game. The joke then became a recurring nickname over the next year.</p>

  <h3 id="thief">Initial attempts to steal</h3>
  <p>In late 2022, European dictator Neil Divins stated in a group of people that he would steal the joke. Following this point, Cameron and Neil would argue over who created the joke, though everyone sided with Cameron. This argument eventually eclipsed the original joke, because The Boys deemed watching Neil get angry over people not believing him to be funnier than the original bit.</p>

  <h3 id="old">Old Man Smeff</h3>
  <p><a href="Old Man Smeff Mancala.html">Main article: Old Man Smeff Mancala</a></p>
  <p>During one such argument, Old Man Smeff Mancala revealed himself to Neil and Cameron. This brought the bit to new heights, as Smeff personified was able to join the argument and fight for his own autonomy.</p>

  <h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
  <p>Smeff was an immediate hit, becomming one of the most referenced bits among The Boys. It has one of the highest contribution rates of any bit, with all of The Boys contributing at least once.</p>

  <h3 id="criticism">Opinions from the cuck community</h3>
  <p>The cuckold (cuck) community has been very harsh, often denying Cameron as the creator of the joke altogether. The cuck community has comdemned Smeff as offensive to their culture and have attempted to "reclaim" the word. This has failed by all metrics, as Smeff is still in comman use among non-cucks.</p>
  <p>A primary example of Cameron-denial among the cuck community is shown here in this tweet by long-term Cameron hater Donald Trump.</p>

  <h3 id="explain">Explain it With Smeff</h3>

It has drawn widespread praise from academics as one of the best educational tools on the planet. The success of Explain it With Smeff has enabled the foundation of the Smeff Scholarship, a scholarship aiming to help indigenous youths.</p>

  <h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>
  <p>Smeff has been declared the funniest joke of all time in the Joke of the Year 2025 awards. Smeff prevails as one of the funniest things Cameron has ever said, and has inspired him to start the Explain it With Smeff Foundation.</p>

  <h3 id="early">Early life</h3>
  <p>Cameron was born October 9, 2003, to lower-middle class parents. His mother divorced his father when he was young, because he was a cuck. Cameron had an interest in technology and language from an early age, and tried to learn about programming for the first time at age 5. He attempted to learn Mandarin Chinese at age 8, leading to the start of his interest in Asian languages.</p>
  <p>Cameron left public school for online school during 5th grade, allowing him access to coursework that he would otherwise lack access to. He started to learn Japanese at Elizabethtown College at age 15, later skipping a year of high school to start full time sooner. Prior to his bachelor's, he made his first video game in 6502 assembly for the Nintendo Entertainment System.</p>

  <h2 id="boys">University and The Boys</h2>
  <p>Cameron started university at age 17 as a Japanese and Computer Science major, later switching the latter to Information Systems. Through his academics, he met a group of rascals whom he made friends with. This group later formed The Boys, an international shenanigan creating organization. With The Boys, Cameron got the idea to create the famous site SusFeed from a series of parody article ideas intended to make fun of the news site BuzzFeed.</p>
  <P>With the later expansion of SusFeed, the invention of susarticles, and the creation of SusFeed Video, Cameron used his influence to start researching the Ainu language from Hokkaido. This took some time away from SusFeed, leading to the great hiatus. Cameron came back for a full revamp of the site in 2025, remaining active online since.</P>

  <p><b>Sir Richard Starkey</b> (born 7 July 1940), known as <b>Ringo Starr</b>, is an English musician, actor, cereal mascot, and business mogul who achieved international fame as the drummer for the Beatles, the mascot for the cereal brand Reese's Puffs, and an executive at SusFeed. Though he was historicall known for his work with The Beatles on songs such as "<i>Yellow Submarine</i>"" and "<i>With a Little Help from My Friends</i>", his groundbreaking research on the puffs and contributions to SusFeed have far eclipsed his prior career.</p>

  <h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>
  <p>Starr was born  on 7 July 1940 in Dingle, an actual real place in Liverpool, to a family of confectioners. Starr's father left when he was young, leaving Starr with no real memories of his father. An ill child, Starr learned how to play drums during a two-year stay hospital for tuberculosis. Starr showed a great aptitude for art from a young age, using music to keep spirits high in crime-ridded Dingle.</p>
  <p>Starr entered the workforce to little success in 1955, starting at a rail company. He was, however, unable to pass the physical examination and was let off with unemployment benefits into the cold hard streets of Dingle. In mid-1956, Starr started working as a waiter on a boat, where he met many of his future connections in the music industry.</p>

  <h2 id="career">Musical career</h2>
  <P>He was in a few bands before landing on some band called The Beatles. They made some albums or something? More importantly, this band is where he met John Lennon, his first romantic partner and best friend. The Beatles would later break up in 1970, but Ringo and John would remain lovers for the next decade. Starr released various solo projects until John's assassination in 1980, which led to a great depression for Starr.</P>

  <h2 id="depression">Depression</h2>
  <p>Following John's death, Starr fell into a depression for 9 years. With a renewed spirit, he founded his All-Starr Band in 1989, though his depression seemingly grew as his performances reminded him of John. In 1994, Starr had a deppressive episode when recounting how he and John used to jerk each other, leading him to contemplate suicide for several months.</p>

  <h2 id="puffs">The puffs</h2>
  <p>Starr's ideation came to a head in late 1994, where he nearly attempted suicide. Before the attempt, however, Starr wanted one last meal, leading to his tasting of the brand-new cereal, Reese's Puffs. After one bite of the puffs, Starr's suicidal ideation disappeared completely, giving him a renewed love for life and allowing him to continue toruign with his All-Starr band. Starr has later credited the puffs with saving his life on multiple occaisions, saying "if it weren't for the puffs, I'd have killed meself long ago".</p>

  <h3 id="mascot">Reese's Puffs mascot</h3>
  <P>Since this fateful encounter, Starr has acted as the mascot for Reese's Puffs in all forms of advertising. To date, Starr has posed in dozens of photos and filmed 20 commercials for the brand, driving up sales by an estimated 1000% after his initial ad. Starr's wealth primarily comes from his payments from The Hershey Company and his stock in SusFeed.</P>

  <h3 id="susfeed">Ringo Starr's SusFeed</h3>
  <p>In 2025, Starr purchased a significant share in SusFeed, leading to the launch of Ringo Starr's SusFeed, a spin-off of the main site. Ringo Starr's SusFeed acts as a portal for both Starr's personal content and promotions for the Reese's Puffs brand. Starr has used his funds from SusFeed to distribute Reese's Puffs to everyone on the planet, ending depression completely, and revitalizing his hometown of Dingle.</p>
